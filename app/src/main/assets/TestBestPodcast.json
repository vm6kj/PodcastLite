But host Porter Braswell (Jopwell) is on a mission to create a safe space to share those stories – and learn from them. Hear leaders from business and government trace their personal journeys with race, equity, and inclusion. And learn from their mistakes and their triumphs.\n\nThe views expressed on this podcast are those of its hosts, guests, and callers, and not those of Harvard Business Review.",

There are plenty of amazing podcasts out there but I find very few tailors their content to those in high-school and uni. Even the ones that claim they do seem to go off track and fail to keep their message clear and simple for the younger generation to understand.I believe our world is changing so fast, the current education system can’t keep up and is left teaching us old and outdated skills no longer relevant in the workplace.This podcasts explores what I believe should have been taught in school and aims to help people realise the world is different from when their parents grew up and we must make relevant decisions based on the world we live in currently not the world people used to live in.",

      "description": "The Unemployables Podcast is hosted by Chicago-based comedians Sean Ely, Corey Wagner and Zako Ryan, with new episodes every Monday morning everywhere podcasts are found.\n\nThe trio tackles viewer-submitted questions about sex, entrepreneurship, dating etiquette, foot fetishes, overcoming anxiety, butt stuff and ... OK, let's face it: There's a lot of questions about boning. Just being real.\n\nSean, Corey and Zako also dive into their lives as comics and creators, and often tap into how the \"unemployable\" mentality leaves room for major opportunities outside of sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day.\n\nWhether you've got your daily commute, a long flight or the treadmill cranked up to 15, The Unemployables Podcast is ready for you to inappropriately laugh for an hour each week. Enjoy, you sex machine, you.\n\nSpecial thanks to the producers at Pro-Ject, who make this entire podcast possible, and our video crew, We Are A Team, for all the crispy footage.",
